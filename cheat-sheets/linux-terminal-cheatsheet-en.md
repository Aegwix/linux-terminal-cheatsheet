## About the terminal

A **terminal** is a tool which allows users to interact directly with their operating systems through text prompts, rather than a graphic interface.

Here's how it usually works:

* **Inserting the prompt:** You write down a valid command that gives instructions to your system.
* **Processing:** The shell tries to understand the command and execute the corresponding action (copy a file, display a list of directories, etc.)
* **Displays results:** The terminal displays an appropriate response (or error message), according to the command.

**Use terminal commands:**  
     1. Open the terminal.  
     2. Write out the prompts.  
     3. See the results.

## Bash vs Zsh

### About Bash

#### Bash (Bourne Again Shell) Introduction

Bash is a command interpreter mainly used on Unix and Linux systems. It is an improved version of the original Bourne shell (sh) and is now one of the most popular shells in the Unix/Linux environment. It allows users to execute commands in the command line, automate processes via scripts, and interact efficiently with the operating system.

#### Bash Strong Points

* **Scripting** ‚úçÔ∏è  
  ‚ûù Bash enables the creation of complex scripts thanks to control structures and its great flexibility. It also allows the automation of repetitive tasks and workflow optimization.

* **Portability** üåç  
  ‚ûù Bash scripts are portable across multiple Linux and Unix distributions. This makes it easier to create universal solutions for developers and system administrators.

* **Command Memory** üß†  
  ‚ûù Bash has features that enable command auto-completion, saving time and reducing typing errors. Additionally, it keeps a history of previous commands, allowing users to reuse them easily.

* **Process Management** ‚öôÔ∏è  
  ‚ûù Bash provides the ability to manage background processes (interrupt, suspend, or redirect them), offering better flexibility.

#### Bash Weak Points

* **Script Complexity** üòï  
  ‚ûù While using command lines is relatively simple for beginners, understanding script syntax and error handling can be challenging to master.

* **Lack of a Graphical Interface** üñ•Ô∏è‚ùå  
  ‚ûù Bash is primarily command-line oriented and lacks graphical interfaces.

* **Modern Applications** üì±üíª  
  ‚ûù Although it excels at managing files and processes, Bash is limited when it comes to running or managing modern applications that require richer or more specific environments, such as graphical interfaces.

### About Zsh

#### Zsh Introduction

Like Bash, Zsh is a powerful interactive command interpreter. It is used in Unix and Linux environments and offers a smooth and efficient experience thanks to its many advanced features.  
It is highly appreciated by developers and system administrators as it allows fast navigation and extensive terminal customization.

  ‚ûù Create short commands to speed up task execution.

* **Bash Compatibility** üîÑ  
  ‚ûù Runs existing Bash scripts without issues.

* **Separated `$PATH` Management** üìÅ  
  ‚ûù `$PATH` is handled as an array (`$path`), making it easier to manage.

#### Zsh Weak Points

* **Higher Resource Consumption** üñ•Ô∏è  
  ‚ûù More memory-intensive than Bash, especially with **Oh My Zsh** and multiple plugins enabled.

* **Longer Startup Time** ‚è≥  
  ‚ûù Can slow down on launch if too many heavy plugins or themes are loaded.

* **Imperfect Compatibility with Some Scripts** ‚ö†Ô∏è  
  ‚ûù Some scripts specifically written for Bash may require adjustments.

* **More Complex Configuration** üîß  
  ‚ûù Requires more customization to fully take advantage of its features.

* **Dependency on Oh My Zsh for Beginners** üèóÔ∏è  
  ‚ûù Many popular features require additional frameworks.

* **Less Native Support on Some Systems** üì¶  
  ‚ûù Not installed by default on all Linux distributions and macOS (requires manual installation).

* **Longer Learning Curve for Beginners** üìò

  ‚ûù Most tutorials and online solutions are geared towards Bash.

### Comparison: Bash vs Zsh

Bash and Zsh are two of the most popular **command interpreters** on Unix and Linux.  
Both allow users to execute commands, navigate files, and automate tasks through scripts.  
However, despite their shared foundations, their differences in **features, customization, and performance** can influence a user's choice.

#### Main Functions

| Feature                 | Bash ‚úÖ | Zsh ‚úÖ |
|-------------------------|--------|--------|
| Auto-completion        | Basic  | Advanced (dynamic suggestions) |
| Auto-correction        | ‚ùå No  | ‚úÖ Yes (fixes typos) |
| Customization         | Limited | Very advanced with **Oh My Zsh** |
| History Management     | Standard | ‚úÖ Enhanced (removes duplicates, shared across sessions) |
| Fast Navigation       | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes (*z plugin*, **improved cd**) |
| `$PATH` Separation      | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes (*managed as an array*, easier to edit) |
| Bash Scripts           | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes (*compatible with Bash*) |
| Process Management     | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Default Installation   | ‚úÖ Yes (Linux/macOS) | ‚ùå No (must be installed manually) |

#### Final Verdict

The choice between **Bash and Zsh** primarily depends on the **user‚Äôs needs and preferences**.  

* **If maximum compatibility and simplicity are the goal**, Bash is sufficient. It is **pre-installed** on most systems and has **extensive documentation**.  
* **If you want a more modern, interactive, and ergonomic experience**, Zsh is a more attractive alternative.  
* **In a professional environment**, Zsh can provide a **significant productivity boost** thanks to its **advanced auto-completion, optimized history management, and plugins**.  

However, while Zsh offers more features, **it requires initial configuration** to fully take advantage of them. For occasional users, this customization **may not be necessary**.  

Overall, **Zsh is an excellent choice for those who spend a lot of time in the terminal**, while Bash remains a solid option for **its ease of use**.  

## Installation

| Outils | Debian/Ubuntu (`apt`) | Arch Linux  (`pacman`) | Documentation |
| ------ | --- | --- | --- |
| **Bash** | `sudo apt install bash` | `sudo pacman -S bash` | [Documentation Bash](https://www.gnu.org/doc/doc.html) |
| **Zsh** | `sudo apt install zsh` | `sudo pacman -S zsh` | [Documentation Zsh](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/) |

Once you're done with the installation, you'll be able to use the cmmands and shortcuts we have presented to you above.

## Configuration

### Bash and Zsh

To modify and configure your shell, you can use the `chsh` command to select the path to the shell you want to use.

You can also run:

```bash
chsh -s <PATH_TO_SHELL>
```

This will directly insert the path to the correct shell.

Once this is done, you need to restart your session. When you open your terminal, the change should take effect.
To be sure, use:

```bash
echo $SHELL
```

This will verify that you are using the correct shell.

#### Example: Switching to Zsh

To change the default shell to Zsh:

* Run the following command:

```bash
chsh -s /bin/zsh
```

* Restart your session.

This will set Zsh as the default shell for the current user.
